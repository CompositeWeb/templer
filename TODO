Brief list of changes to be applied.  Will be updated as I push my live
sites to being generated on my desktop, and not generated in-place via
a hacked version of this script.

   1. Ignore .dotfiles because there are some around.

   2. Ignore emacs saves, because I frequently edit and push at the same time.

When this file is empty development is done.  But even if/when I move to
another generator I'll know pitfalls to look out for.
