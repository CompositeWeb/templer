Brief list of changes to be applied.  Will be updated as I push my live
sites to being generated on my desktop, and not generated in-place via
a hacked version of this script.

   1. Ignore .dotfiles because there are some around.

   2. Ignore emacs saves, because I frequently edit and push at the same time.

   3. Confirm that symlinks work correctly as assets.  Specifically I'm concerned
      that porting the static site might be a challenge due to symlinks:
        http://static.steve.org.uk/js/
      A potential solution is to use rsync to copy the input assets to the output
      directory.  Or tar.  Or something else horribly icky & unpleasant.

When this file is empty development is done.  But even if/when I move to
another generator I'll know pitfalls to look out for.
